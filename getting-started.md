# Getting Started

1. [Get a GitHub account](https://github.com/join) if you don't have one already.
2. Email <patrick.hammons@phila.gov> to be added to the City of Philadelphia organization and your department's team
3. Download and install [GitHub For Windows](http://windows.github.com/). If you have problems connecting to GitHub through this client you may have a firewall issue that the [Web Proxy Readme](https://github.com/CityOfPhiladelphia/github-for-geodata/blob/master/web-proxy.md) can help with.
